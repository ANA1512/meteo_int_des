# meteo_int_des
What's the weather today ? 
So here's the plan I have for my simple meteo application; (it's a practical training exercise in design -integration - animation).
👉🏿 Design - 
👉🏿Prototyping on Figma

✅API search in JavaScript. 
✅Integration (HTML/CSS/JS)
Animation with GSAP

🧐Adding sound effects ? 
🧐Adding extra features ? 

👉🏿Testing the application on different browsers (testing users -iteration)
👉🏿deploy with Vercel 
  (desktop PWA-serice worker)
  other step =>  mobile app flutter?
